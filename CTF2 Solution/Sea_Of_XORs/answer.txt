the key was the flag starting from "flag{" which we already knew.
Xored all the lines seperately and guessed the words not completely
appearing in the semi-decrypted text. Then from  the guessed word 
we extended the flag and saw if the now decrypted text lines makes
sense. Did this repeatedly till we had the flag.
